## Exercise 2: Advanced Batch Scripting
Create a batch script named "BackupScript.bat" that creates a backup of files with the ".docx" extension from the "Documents" folder to a new folder named "DocBackup" on the desktop.

```@echo off
mkdir %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
copy %userprofile%\Documents\*.docx %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
echo Backup completed successfully!
```

Modify the script to delete files with the ".docx" extension from the "Documents" folder after creating the backup.
```
@echo off
mkdir %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
copy %userprofile%\Documents\*.docx %userprofile%\Desktop\DocBackup
del %userprofile%\Documents\*.docx
echo Backup and deletion completed successfully!
